# Alternative Use Cases for Group Jars

Beyond the standard "Squad Mode" (friends hanging out), the shared Jar architecture can be adapted for various other domains.

## 1. The "Household Operations" Jar
Solving domestic disputes and decision fatigue.
*   **The Dinner Dilemma:** A shared jar for couples/families populated with *recipes* or *local takeout spots*. Spin to decide dinner.
*   **Gamified Chores:** A "Chore Jar". Use **Task Allocation Mode** to fairly distribute the week's chores across the whole household in seconds. No more picking favorites—let the AI handle the split.
*   **The "I'm Bored" Jar (Kids):** Parents populate it with screen-free activities ("Build a fort", "Draw a cat"). Kids spin when they complain of boredom.

## 2. The "Office & Team Culture" Jar
Enhancing workplace engagement.
*   **Lunch Roulette:** Colleagues often struggle to pick a lunch spot. A jar of local favorites makes it fun and fair.
*   **Icebreaker / Standup:** A jar of "Questions of the Day" for agile standups or team meetings to build rapport.
*   **The "Kudos" Jar:** Team members drop notes of appreciation into a digital jar. Once a month, "Spin" to read one out and give a prize.
*   **Hackathon / Brainstorming:** A jar of constraints or topics. Spin two jars (e.g. "Industry" + "Technology") to generate random startup ideas.

## 3. The "Self-Improvement" Tribe
Accountability groups.
*   **Workout of the Day (WOD):** A fitness group shares a jar of workouts. Spin to see what everyone does today (even remotely).
*   **Book Club Picker:** Members submit book choices. Spin to select the next read.
*   **Challenge Jar:** "Cold Shower", "No Sugar", "10k Steps". A group agrees to do whatever the jar dictates for the day.

## 4. Event Companion (Weddings/Parties)
Using the app as a temporary event guide.
*   **The Wedding Guest Challenge:** A jar shared via QR code at tables. Guests spin to get a photo challenge ("Take a selfie with the groom", "Find someone with a red tie").
*   **Pub Crawl Randomizer:** A jar of bars. Spin to see where the group moves next.

## 5. Educational / Classroom
*   **Student Picker:** Teachers use it to randomly select students for answers (fairness).
*   **Activity Stations:** Students spin to see which learning station they go to next.
