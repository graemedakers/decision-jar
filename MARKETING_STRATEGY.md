# Date Jar - Social Media Marketing Strategy

## 1. Core Value Proposition
**"Stop asking 'What do you want to do?' and start making memories."**
Focus on the pain point of *indecision* in relationships and the *excitement* of spontaneity.

## 2. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** Couples (Gen Z & Millennials, ages 18-35) in long-term relationships.
*   **Secondary:** Roommates and Families looking for fair task distribution; people newly dating who want to impress.
*   **Interests:** Dating advice, relationship memes, travel, organization/lifestyle tips, budget tips.

## 2.1 Marketing Angles
*   **Romantic Spark:** Saving date night from indecision.
*   **Roommate Harmony:** Using **Task Allocation** to end chore wars (e.g., "The Jar decided you're doing the dishes").
*   **Family Fun:** Crowdsourcing weekend plans with kids.

## 3. Platform Strategy

### A. TikTok & Instagram Reels (Viral Growth)
This is your most important channel. The visual nature of the "Spin" is perfect for short-form video.

*   **Content Pillar 1: "The Indecision Problem" (Relatable Humor)**
    *   *Skit:* POV of a couple arguing about where to eat for 2 hours.
    *   *Solution:* One partner pulls out the app, hits "Spin", and they instantly have a plan.
    *   *Audio:* Trending couple/argument sounds.

*   **Content Pillar 2: "Date Night Reveal" (Aesthetic/Vlog)**
    *   *Format:* Show the phone screen spinning -> Cut to a montage of them actually *doing* the date (e.g., Pottery Class, Picnic).
    *   *Caption:* "The Jar chose our date tonight 🏺✨ #datejar #datenight"

*   **Content Pillar 3: "Date Ideas Series" (Value)**
    *   "3 Date Ideas Under $20 to add to your Jar"
    *   "Best Indoor Date Ideas for Rainy Days"
    *   *Call to Action:* "Download Date Jar to save these!"

### B. Pinterest (Search Traffic)
Couples constantly search Pinterest for "Date Night Ideas".

*   **Strategy:** Create vertical pins with lists of date ideas (e.g., "10 Fall Date Ideas").
*   **Link:** Direct traffic to your landing page or a blog post if you have one.
*   **Visuals:** Aesthetic photos of dates with the Date Jar logo overlay.

### C. Twitter/X (Community & Memes)
*   Share relatable tweets about dating struggles.
*   "My boyfriend said 'I don't know' so I let the app decide. We're going skydiving. Pray for him."

## 4. Influencer Marketing (Micro-Influencers)
You don't need celebrities. You need real couples.

*   **Target:** "Couples Accounts" with 5k-50k followers.
*   **Offer:** Free Lifetime Premium Access + Small Commission (if you set up an affiliate program) or a flat fee ($50-$100).
*   **Brief:** Ask them to film a "Letting an app decide our date night" video.

## 5. Launch Campaign Ideas

### "The 30-Day Date Challenge"
*   Challenge couples to go on 4 dates in 30 days using the Jar.
*   Users post their dates on IG/TikTok with `#DateJarChallenge`.
*   **Prize:** $100 Gift Card for a fancy dinner (or refund their premium fee).

### "Worst Date Story" Contest
*   Ask users to comment their worst "I don't know, what do you want to do?" story.
*   Pick a winner to get free access.

## 6. Paid Advertising (Low Budget Start)
*   **TikTok Spark Ads:** Boost your best-performing organic video.
*   **Instagram Stories:** Simple poll ad: "Do you hate planning dates?" [Yes/No].

## 7. App Store Optimization (ASO)
*   **Keywords:** Date ideas, relationship app, decision maker, random picker, couple games.
*   **Screenshots:** Use bright, high-contrast screenshots showing the "Spin" and the "Result".
