## 1. Introduction

Decision Jar allows you to create shared collections of activity ideas with your partner, friends, or family. When you're ready for an adventure, simply "spin the jar" to get a random suggestion based on your current preferences.

---

## 2. Getting Started

### Sign Up
1.  Navigate to the landing page.
2.  Click the **"Get Started"** button.
3.  Enter your name and email.
4.  **Location:** Enter your city (e.g., "New York, NY"). This helps our Concierge tools suggest relevant venues nearby.
    - **Smart Detection:** On mobile and supported browsers, the app will ask for permission to use your **GPS**. This ensures "nearby" searches are pinpoint accurate to your current location.
    - **Fallback:** If GPS is disabled, the app uses your Profile Location, then your Jar Location, then a general "local" context.
5.  **Create Jar:**
    - Choose a **Name** and **Topic** (e.g., "Dates", "Movies", "Food", "Activities").
    - Select a **Selection Mode** (Random spin, Voting Session, or Task Allocation).

**Note:** You can create and join up to 3 jars for free! Create separate jars for different contexts—romantic dates, friend activities, solo hobbies, or family outings. Switch between them easily using the header menu. Pro users can manage up to 50 jars.

---

## 3. Managing Jars & Members

### Manage Your Jars
Click the **Jar Name** in the dashboard header to open the Jar Switcher. From there, select **"Manage My Jars"** to view and organize all your collections.

#### Jar Actions
*   **Rename (Admin Only):** Click the **Pencil icon** next to a jar name to rename it.
*   **Delete (Admin Only):** Click the **Trash icon** to permanently delete a jar and all its contents. This requires double confirmation.
*   **Jar Gifting:** Want to share your curated list of ideas with a friend? Click the **Gift icon** (🎁) to generate a "Gift Copy" link. When they open it, a new independent copy of your jar will be created for them.
*   **Leave (Member Only):** If you are not the administrator, you can leave a jar at any time.

#### Member Management (Admin Only)
As an administrator, you can click the **"Members"** button next to a jar to:
*   **View All Members:** See names and emails of everyone in the jar.
*   **Manage Roles:** Promote members to **Admin** or demote other admins to **Member**.
*   **Safety Rule:** A jar must always have at least one administrator. You cannot demote yourself if you are the last admin.
