## 1. Introduction

Decision Jar allows you to create shared collections of activity ideas with your partner, friends, or family. When you're ready for an adventure, simply "spin the jar" to get a random suggestion based on your current preferences.

### Sign Up
1.  Navigate to the landing page.
2.  Click the **"Get Started"** button.
3.  Enter your name and email.
4.  **Location:** Enter your city (e.g., "New York, NY"). This helps our Concierge tools suggest relevant venues nearby.
5.  **Create Jar:**
    - Choose a **Name** and **Topic** (e.g., "Food", "Movies", "General").
    - Select a **Type** (Romantic, Community, or Social).

## 3. Managing Jars & Members

### Manage Your Jars
Click the **Jar Name** in the dashboard header to open the Jar Switcher. From there, select **"Manage My Jars"** to view and organize all your collections.

#### Jar Actions
*   **Rename (Admin Only):** Click the **Pencil icon** next to a jar name to rename it.
*   **Delete (Admin Only):** Click the **Trash icon** to permanently delete a jar and all its contents. This requires double confirmation.
*   **Leave (Member Only):** If you are not the administrator, you can leave a jar at any time.

#### Member Management (Admin Only)
As an administrator, you can click the **"Members"** button next to a jar to:
*   **View All Members:** See names and emails of everyone in the jar.
*   **Manage Roles:** Promote members to **Admin** or demote other admins to **Member**.
*   **Safety Rule:** A jar must always have at least one administrator. You cannot demote yourself if you are the last admin.

The default mode. Anyone can spin the jar to pick a random idea from the entire pool. Completed ideas move to the Vault.

2.  **My Tasks:** Members see a **"View My Tasks"** button instead of a Spin button. They can only see the tasks assigned to them.
3.  **Completion:** Members select their assigned tasks to mark them as done.

### Voting Mode
Great for group decisions on Movie Night or Dinner.
1.  **Start Vote:** Admin starts a session with a set of random options.
2.  **Vote:** Everyone votes "Yes" or "No" on their own device.
3.  **Result:** The best match is revealed to everyone instantly.
